> after the initail update, i couldn't install any other packages to the chrooted environment. 
for this i ran the command: sudo apt-get -f install
in order to fix all the dependency problem.
after this i was able to continue with all the steps given in the manual.
PS: this problem occured to me when i was using a USB stick instaed of sdcard
